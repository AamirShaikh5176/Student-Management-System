 The Student Management System is a C++ console-based application
 designed to manage student records efficiently. It provides functionalities to
 add, display, search, and delete student records, storing the data in a text file
 (students.txt). The system utilizes file handling to ensure data persistence
 and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to encapsulate student
 information within a class.
 
 The application allows users to input student details such as ID, name, age,
 and course, which are then stored in a structured format. The search
 function enables quick retrieval of student data using a unique ID, while the
 delete function removes records from the file. A simple menu-driven interface
 ensures ease of use.
 
 This project demonstrates essential file operations, structured data
 management, and user interaction in C++. It serves as a foundational
 system for learning data storage, retrieval, and modification in console
 based applications.
